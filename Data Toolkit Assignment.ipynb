    "## Theory Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?**  \n",
    "   NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing. It helps with working on large arrays and matrices, and has many functions for mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How does broadcasting work in NumPy?**  \n",
    "   Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes by stretching the smaller array to match the larger one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is a Pandas DataFrame?**  \n",
    "   A DataFrame is a 2D table in Pandas with rows and columns, like an Excel sheet. It makes handling and analyzing data easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas.**  \n",
    "   The groupby() method groups data based on a column's values, so you can apply functions like sum or mean to each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?**  \n",
    "   Seaborn makes complex visualizations easy and beautiful. It also has built-in themes and works well with Pandas data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists?**  \n",
    "   NumPy arrays are faster and use less memory. They support mathematical operations directly, unlike Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?**  \n",
    "   A heatmap is a color-coded table that shows data intensity. It’s useful for visualizing correlations or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What does the term \"vectorized operation\" mean in NumPy?**  \n",
    "   It means performing operations on entire arrays without using loops, making the code faster and simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?**  \n",
    "   Matplotlib is great for static, simple plots, while Plotly is better for interactive, web-based visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is the significance of hierarchical indexing in Pandas?**  \n",
    "    Hierarchical indexing lets you use multiple levels of row or column labels, making complex data easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What is the role of Seaborn’s pairplot() function?**  \n",
    "    The pairplot() function shows pairwise relationships in a dataset, making it easier to spot correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **What is the purpose of the describe() function in Pandas?**  \n",
    "    The describe() function gives summary statistics like mean, count, and standard deviation for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?**  \n",
    "    Missing data can affect analysis, so it’s important to handle it by filling, dropping, or imputing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?**  \n",
    "    Plotly makes interactive, attractive, and web-friendly visualizations without much effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?**  \n",
    "    NumPy supports arrays with multiple dimensions, allowing you to access elements using multiple indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **What is the role of Bokeh in data visualization?**  \n",
    "    Bokeh helps create interactive, web-ready visualizations with simple, flexible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **Explain the difference between apply() and map() in Pandas.**  \n",
    "    apply() works on rows or columns, while map() works element-wise on a single series.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **What are some advanced features of NumPy?**  \n",
    "    NumPy supports complex math, linear algebra, random sampling, and fast Fourier transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **How does Pandas simplify time series analysis?**  \n",
    "    Pandas makes time-based indexing, resampling, and rolling window calculations easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **What is the role of a pivot table in Pandas?**  \n",
    "    A pivot table summarizes data, making it easier to analyze and explore large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Why is NumPy’s array slicing faster than Python’s list slicing?**  \n",
    "    NumPy arrays use continuous memory blocks, making slicing faster and more memory-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **What are some common use cases for Seaborn?**  \n",
    "    Seaborn is great for visualizing distributions, correlations, categorical data, and statistical plots.\n",
